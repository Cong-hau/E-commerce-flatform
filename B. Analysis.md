- Regarding to Product : Overall, We can give a comment is that family stuffs are favorable items of Bazilians. With the development of economics, Brazilians also want to improve their life experience with useful home furniture and beauty items.

- Relating to the trending purchase of Brazilians, Overall, we can see that E-commerce has experience a sustainable development of total order time by time. Especially , November of 2017, There was a dramatical increasing of ordering, one of explanation for this events is the [Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_Republic_(Brazil)). I believe that E-commerce company had took advantage of this event to promote the business.

- Although family furniture category items as bed_bad_table accounts for the largest number of purchased products, stuffs relating beauty products and luxury items (watches) has the best contribute to total revenue of E-commerce company.

- With the largest of purchasing area as Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais , we can also understand that they are also on top of revenue contribute to company.

    - The majority of late delivery was on holiday occasions as (National day, Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil, Carnival)

- With development of economic and technology, credit card is the first choice in selection of payment with about 80k orders used credit card
  - The time-saving of credit card is the reason make it become the most popular one. 
  - Secondly, Credit card is also linked with the installment of banks and finance services. The procedure to start an installment is easy and fast.

- In over 5k of voucher applied to orders, the security category items accounts for over a half of total. I believe that because of their the high cost and not-easy approaching, the retailers has provided the bunch of vouchers to promote of purchasing.

- [Roraima (RR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roraima) State , [Maranhao (MA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maranh%C3%A3o), [Alagoas (AL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alagoas)  are locations where have the lowest Average Reviews Score with 50% comment.

- In Last 7 days, Nearly New Nautical Website has experienced some significant numbers as:
  - Family and sporty items are the most purchasing items. There are also other trending product following by different months.
  - Company did a great job in delievery service, however it's hard to delievery some remote states limiting by geographical location.
  - Credit card is the most popular finance service 
  - Company service received a great review from customer with majority of 5-star 



- ðŸš© So, I believe that this E-commerce should:
  - Runing creative seasonal marketing campaigns with different items.
  - Doing the suggestion marketing services to promote the business.
  - With remote areas, to promote the services and quality, we should create specific campaigns as giving more vouchers and discounts to these areas to improve their experience.
  - Keep continuing coperating with local business as bank and finance services to upgrade the experience services of customers.
